# Week 1: Advanced Math - Exercises

## Calculus Review

### Topic 1: Limits and Continuity
1. Find the limit: lim(x→2) (x² - 4)/(x - 2)
2. Determine if f(x) = x² is continuous at x = 3
3. Find the limit: lim(x→∞) (3x² + 2x)/(5x² - 1)

### Topic 2: Derivatives
1. Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x⁴ - 2x² + 5
2. Use the product rule to find d/dx[x²·sin(x)]
3. Find the second derivative of f(x) = e^(2x)

## Linear Algebra Basics

### Topic 1: Matrices and Operations
1. Add matrices A and B:
   A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
2. Find the determinant of: [[2, 3], [4, 5]]
3. Calculate AB where A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] and B = [[2, 3], [4, 5]]

### Topic 2: Vectors
